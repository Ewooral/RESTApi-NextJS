# ApaaEmma: so how do i write a git commit message for the utility function created and also moving all local types to the parent global type folder, following the right git message conventional standards?

GitHub Copilot: Writing good commit messages is crucial for maintaining a readable history. The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history.

Here's how you might write a commit message for the changes you described:

```
-`feat:` add getInitialsForAvatar utility function and refactor local types

- Add a new utility function `getInitialsForAvatar` that generates avatar initials from a user's first and last name.
- Move all local types to the parent global type folder for better organization and reusability.
```

This commit message follows the Conventional Commits standard:

- `feat:`: This prefix indicates that the commit introduces a new feature.
- The first line is a short description of the changes.
- The bullet points provide more detailed information about what was changed.

Remember, the goal of a commit message is to clearly and concisely explain what the commit does. It should be understandable not only for you but also for other developers who might work on your project in the future.

# ApaaEmma: which command shows the git message console for the message to be typed in vscode

GitHub Copilot: To write a commit message directly in the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor, you can use the integrated Git support. Here's how:

1. Open the Source Control view by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. It looks like a branch with a circular arrow around it.

2. Stage your changes by clicking on the "+" icon next to each file in the changes list, or click the "+" icon at the top to stage all changes.

3. In the "Message" input box at the top, type your commit message.

4. Press `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Cmd+Enter` on macOS) to commit the changes.

If you want to use the terminal, you can open it in VS Code by selecting `View > Terminal` from the menu or by pressing `` Ctrl+` ``. Then, you can use the `git commit` command to commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

If you want to write a longer commit message with a title and a body, you can use the `-m` option twice:

```bash
git commit -m "Title of your commit" -m "Body of your commit"
```

# ApaaEmma: I create a branch and renamed it but when i do git branch -a, i see the old branch and the renamed branch but when i go on my github, i see only the renamed branch, how do i delete the old branch

- bug/correct-typescript
  main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/bug/correct-typescript
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/feature/correct-typescript-bugs
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/production
  remotes/origin/uat
  (END)

GitHub Copilot: The command `git branch -a` lists all local and remote branches. The branches prefixed with `remotes/origin/` are remote branches, while the others are local.

From your output, it seems like you have renamed the local branch but the old remote branch still exists.

To delete the old remote branch, you can use the `git push` command with the `--delete` option:

```bash
git push origin --delete old-branch-name
```

Replace `old-branch-name` with the name of the branch you want to delete.

To delete a local branch, you can use the `git branch` command with the `-d` option (or `-D` to force delete):

```bash
git branch -d old-branch-name
```

Again, replace `old-branch-name` with the name of the local branch you want to delete.

Please be careful when deleting branches, as this operation cannot be undone.

# ApaaEmma: git push origin --delete feature/correct-typescript-bugs
error: unable to delete 'feature/correct-typescript-bugs': remote ref does not exist
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:EGANOW-FRONTEND-ORG/EGANOW-BUSINESS-WEB-PORTAL-NEXTJS.git'

GitHub Copilot: The error message "remote ref does not exist" means that the branch you're trying to delete does not exist on the remote repository. This could be because the branch was already deleted, or it was never pushed to the remote repository.

If you're sure that the branch exists on the remote repository, you might want to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and try again:

```bash
git fetch origin
git push origin --delete feature/correct-typescript-bugs
```

The `git fetch origin` command updates your local copy of the remote repository. After running this command, your local repository should be up-to-date with the remote repository.

If the branch does not exist on the remote repository, you don't need to do anything else. The branch has already been deleted from the remote repository.

# ApaaEmma: so why do i see the branch when i do git branch -a . check below for remotes/origin/feature/correct-typescript-bugs

- bug/correct-typescript
  main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/main
  remotes/origin/bug/correct-typescript
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/feature/correct-typescript-bugs
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/production
  remotes/origin/uat
  (END)

GitHub Copilot: The `git branch -a` command shows all local and remote branches that your local Git repository knows about. When you delete a branch on the remote repository, your local repository doesn't automatically know about this change. The deleted remote branch will still appear in the list until you update your local repository.

You can update your local list of remote branches with the `git fetch` command with the `--prune` option. This command fetches the latest branches from the remote repository and removes any remote tracking branches which no longer exist on the remote repository.

Here's the command:

```bash
git fetch --prune origin
```

After running this command, `git branch -a` should no longer show the deleted branch.

# ApaaEmma: so for the utility function you've created above, how will you name its branch on github?

GitHub Copilot: When naming a branch for a specific task or feature, it's a good practice to make the branch name descriptive and concise. It should give an idea about the work that's being done in that branch.

For the utility function `getInitialsForAvatar` that we created, a good branch name could be `feature/add-avatar-initials-utility`.

Here's how you can create this branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-avatar-initials-utility
```

This command creates a new branch named `feature/add-avatar-initials-utility` and switches to it.

The `feature/` prefix is used to indicate that this branch is used for adding a new feature. This is a common practice and helps in identifying the purpose of the branch.

# ApaaEmma: is renaming a branch possible on the terminal?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, renaming a branch in Git from the terminal is possible and quite straightforward. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, switch to the branch you want to rename:

```bash
git checkout old-branch-name
```

2. Then, rename the branch:

```bash
git branch -m new-branch-name
```

This will rename the branch in your local repository. If you want to rename the branch in the remote repository as well, you'll need to delete the old branch and push the new one:

```bash
git push origin :old-branch-name new-branch-name
```

And finally, reset the upstream branch for the new-branch-name local branch:

```bash
git push origin -u new-branch-name
```

Please replace `old-branch-name` and `new-branch-name` with your actual branch names. Be careful when renaming branches that are being used by others, as it can cause confusion and potential merge conflicts.

# ApaaEmma: so how about the typescript changes i made, how will the branch name be?

  GitHub Copilot: If the changes you made are related to fixing TypeScript issues, you could name the branch something like `fix/typescript-issues`. If the changes are more specific, you could include that in the branch name. For example, if you updated TypeScript types, you could use `update/typescript-types`.

Here's how you can create this branch:

```bash
git checkout -b fix/typescript-issues
```

This command creates a new branch named `fix/typescript-issues` and switches to it.

The `fix/` prefix is used to indicate that this branch is used for fixing an issue. This is a common practice and helps in identifying the purpose of the branch.

# ApaaEmma: i moved all local types into their parent global type folder, what should the branch name be?

  GitHub Copilot: If you moved all local types into their parent global type folder, a descriptive branch name could be `refactor/move-local-types-to-global`. This indicates that the branch contains refactoring work related to moving local types to a global location.

Here's how you can create this branch:

```bash
git checkout -b refactor/move-local-types-to-global
```

This command creates a new branch named `refactor/move-local-types-to-global` and switches to it.

The `refactor/` prefix is used to indicate that this branch is used for refactoring code. This is a common practice and helps in identifying the purpose of the branch.

## Can pull requests be created using the terminal

Yes, you can create pull requests from the terminal using Git and GitHub's command line tool, `gh`. Here are the steps:

1. **Install the GitHub CLI**: If you haven't already, you'll need to install the GitHub CLI. You can find instructions on the [official GitHub CLI page](https://cli.github.com/).

2. **Create a new branch**: Use Git to create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
  git checkout -b feature/getInitials
```

3. **Make your changes**: Add the `getInitialsForAvatar_util` function to `utils.ts`, or make whatever other changes you need.

4. **Commit your changes**: Use Git to stage and commit your changes:

```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add getInitialsForAvatar_util function"
```

5. **Push your branch**: Push your new branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature/getInitials
```

6. **Create the pull request**: Use the `gh` tool to create a new pull request:

```bash
gh pr create --title "Add getInitialsForAvatar_util function" --body "This PR adds a new utility function for getting initials for avatars."
```

The `gh pr create` command will prompt you to choose the base repository and branch (typically the `main` or `master` branch of the original repository), and the head repository and branch (typically the branch you just pushed). After you've made these selections, it will create the pull request.

Remember to replace the placeholders in these commands with the actual details of your changes.

## Can I switch or checkout a remote branch from my terminal?

Yes, you can checkout the `remotes/origin/dev` branch from your local repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Fetch all branches from the remote repository**:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

2. **Checkout the specific branch**: This will switch to the `dev` branch.

```bash
git checkout dev
```

If the `dev` branch does not exist locally, Git will create it and set it up to track the remote `dev` branch.

Please note that you don't need to clone the repository again if you already have it locally. The `git fetch` command updates your local repository with all branches and commits from the remote repository. The `git checkout` command then switches to the specific branch you want to work on.
