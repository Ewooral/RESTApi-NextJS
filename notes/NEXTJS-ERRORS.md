## Hydration failed
Error: Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.

**Answer**
I apologize for the frustration. The issue you're facing is likely due to the Image component from next/image not being able to load the image during server-side rendering, which causes a mismatch between the server and client render.

To fix this, you can use a state variable to delay the rendering of the Image component until after the component has mounted on the client side. Here's how you can modify your code:

    ```tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import Image from 'next/image';
// ... other imports ...

const DashboardPage = () => {
  const { user } = userStore();
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen bg-gray-200">
      {/* ... other code ... */}
      <div className="flex-1 p-10 text-2xl font-bold">
        <span> Content goes here...</span>
        {isClient && user.imageName && (
          <div className='avatar'>
            <Image src={`/uploads/${user.imageName}`} alt='' width={200} height={200} />
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default withAuth(DashboardPage);
    ```

    I apologize for the frustration. The issue you're facing is likely due to the `Image` component from `next/image` not being able to load the image during server-side rendering, which causes a mismatch between the server and client render.

To fix this, you can use a state variable to delay the rendering of the `Image` component until after the component has mounted on the client side. Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import Image from 'next/image';
// ... other imports ...

const DashboardPage = () => {
  const { user } = userStore();
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen bg-gray-200">
      {/* ... other code ... */}
      <div className="flex-1 p-10 text-2xl font-bold">
        <span> Content goes here...</span>
        {isClient && user.imageName && (
          <div className='avatar'>
            <Image src={`/uploads/${user.imageName}`} alt='' width={200} height={200} />
          /</div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default withAuth(DashboardPage);
```

In this code, `isClient` is a state variable that is initially `false` and is set to `true` after the component mounts on the client side. The `Image` component is only rendered if `isClient` is `true`, which ensures that the `Image` component is not rendered during server-side rendering. This should prevent the hydration error.
